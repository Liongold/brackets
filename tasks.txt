	Fix: Replace callback(latestChosen) with callback(0, [latestChosen]);
	Bug: Killing page
		Fix: In DocumentCommandHandler line 355:
			                        if(paths.length == 1) {
                            				console.log(1);
                            				filesToOpen = paths;

                        				paths.forEach(function (path) {
                           					 filesToOpen.push(FileSystem.getFileForPath(path));

                Fixed by replace ; with ,
                    Open works fine but has two problems:
                        Opens two rows in sidebar
                        Full Path is shown as name in one of them 
                            Fixed this by adding call to FileUtils.getBaseName
                                Fixed both by implementing watchers
